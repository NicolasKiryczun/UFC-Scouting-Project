## About the Project

MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) is a sport that relies heavily on its individual stars to generate revenue. Recognizing the importance of stars also means recognizing the importance of scouting stars. This task is easier said than done, as many prospects go on to become “busts,” or fighters who failed to reach their superstardom potential.

This project aims at using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn to provide insights into common superstar traits, comparing these traits to the average fighter, and producing a “Superstar Calculator” which intakes a fighter’s stats and outputs a “Superstar Score” indicating their potential.

The dataset used in this project is titled “Ultimate UFC Dataset” on Kaggle. It is based on all UFC fighter statistics from 2010 to 2024. The dataset includes over 3,000 UFC fighters, each with stats ranging from physical attributes (height, reach, etc.) to in-fight records (longest win streak, wins by submission, etc.). Data wrangling for this dataset requires the transformation of a per-fight index to a per-fighter index and involved the creation of a subset table called “superstars” for later comparisons.

The results from the analysis of the data revealed that superstars tended to have long reaches, long winning streaks, and high finishing rates. When comparing these commonalities with the average UFC fighter, it was clear to see that superstars easily surpassed benchmark fighters in all three categories. The “Superstar Score” was created and used on the dataset and several specific fighters to display its credibility.

These insights and tools can be used to help MMA promotions find talent using quantitative analysis, allowing them to filter through various fighters and corroborate their intuition with what the numbers say. Doing this will lead to an increase in prospect pipeline success rates, leading to revenue-generating superstars.
